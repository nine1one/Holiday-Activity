# 🎄 Holiday Activity — Decorative Repository 🎆

![Holiday banner](./assets/holiday-simple-banner.svg)

A tiny, festive repository created by [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/?ct=holiday) to add cheerful activity to the GitHub contribution graph and profile activity overview.

Purpose
- Decorative, short-lived commits and tiny edits that show up on your GitHub activity timeline.
- Seasonal flair — Christmas and New Year themed banner and small changes.
- Not a production project: lightweight, ephemeral, and safe to archive or remove later.

How to use
- Make a minimal edit (a line, emoji or small file) and commit using Working Copy, GitHub web UI, or your preferred Git client.
- Keep changes small and occasional to preserve the repository's temporary nature.

Files
- assets/holiday-banner.svg — Festive SVG banner (Christmas + New Year).
- README.md — This file.

Credits
- Banner created for visual decoration by the repository owner: nine1one.

Happy holidays! 🎁✨
